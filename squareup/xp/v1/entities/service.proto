/**
 * Typically, a Square merchant has a single account that they use to process all of their payments and manage all of their items.
 * However, if a merchant's business has multiple physical locations, the merchant might have a different Square account for each location.
 * Sometimes in this case, the merchant has a special business account that helps them manage all of their single-location accounts.
 *
 * A merchant can authorize your application with their business account just as they would with a single-location account.
 * If they do, your application can do the following (assuming you requested the necessary permission scope during authorization):

 * Make calls to Connect API endpoints acting as any of the business account's individual locations
 * Make calls to List endpoints (such as List Payments or List Items) that return aggregated results from all of the business account's individual locations
 * Important: Business accounts do not have their own payments, items, or other entities.
 * If you attempt to create an item and provide the merchant_id of a business account, the request will fail with an error.
