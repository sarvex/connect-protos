 * Provides summary information for all deposits and withdrawals initiated by Square to a merchant's bank account during a date range.
 * Date ranges cannot exceed one year in length. See Date ranges for details of inclusive and exclusive dates.
 *
 * Settlement objects returned by this endpoint do not include the entries field, which lists the transactions that contribute to the total of the settlement.
 * To get a particular settlement's entries, use the Retrieve Settlement endpoint.
 *
 * Square initiates its regular deposits to merchant bank accounts on the schedule indicated on this page.
 * A deposit initiated by Square on a given day is usually not provided by this endpoint before 10 p.m. PST the same day.
 *
 * Square does not know when an initiated settlement completes, only whether it has failed.
 * A completed settlement is typically reflected in a merchant's bank account within three business days, but in exceptional cases it might take longer.
